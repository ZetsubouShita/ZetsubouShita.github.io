	<h2>Directions to My Office</h2>
	<div>
		Finding your way to The Ohio State University is easy. It is in the center of Columbus, slightly north of
		downtown.
		<h3>From the North:</h3>
		<p>Take any major highway to I-270. Take I-270 to SR 315 south. From SR 315 south, exit at Lane Avenue.</p>

		<h3>From the South:</h3>
		<p>Take any major highway to I-71 north. Take I-71 north to SR 315 north. Exit at Lane Avenue.</p>

		<h3>From the West:</h3>
		<p>Take any major highway to I-70 east. Take I-70 east to SR 315 north. Exit at Lane Avenue.</p>

		<h3>From the East:</h3>
		<p>Take any major highway to I-70 west. Take I-70 west to SR 315 north. Exit at Lane Avenue.</p>

		<h3>From John Glenn International Airport:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Take I-670 west to I-71 south.
			</li>
			<li>
				Take I-71 south to I-70 west.
			</li>
			<li>
				Take I-70 west to SR 315 north. Exit at Lane Avenue.
			</li>
			<li>
				Take Lane Avenue (going east into OSU) over the bridge until you reach Tuttle Park Place road.
			</li>
			<li>
				Take a right onto Tuttle Park Place road and continue down (shortly) through the big 4-way intersection
				(intersecting with Woody Hayes Dr.).
			</li>
			<li>
				Shortly after the intersection you will see a large parking garage on your left (with an immediate
				entrance into the garage from the road).
			</li>
			<li>
				The OSU Stadium will be directly on your right. Enter this garage and take the
				ticket to park your car (we will give you a pass later to exit the garage at no charge).
			</li>


		</ol>

		<p>I am located in office 491 Dreese Labs, directly adjacent (behind) to the parking garage. It is the tallest
			red
			brick building in the immediate area. It also has a characteristic white "spool" on the very top of the
			building.</p>

		<p>Dreese Labs (building 279) and the parking garage (building 088) are shown on this helpful <a
				href="https://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279" target="_blank">map</a>.</p>
